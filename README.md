# Before getting started
Be prepared for (hopefully) funny real-life comparisons and more focus on real-world applications and less on theory. This course is a "Getting started" with JWT. If you already know a lot about it, but want to build something together, feel free to skip to the practical bits. 

# Setup for building an app together
- Clone this repo
- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- You don't need an IDE but it might make life easier. We're going to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Get some coffee / water / tea ☕️ 🥤

# Prerequisites
We're going to write Javascript and use Express. You don't need to know a lot about them, but some basic understanding before the course is preferrable.
